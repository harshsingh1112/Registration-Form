### **Styling Highlights**

- **Modern Color Scheme:**  
  - Background: A soothing dark tone (#1b1b32) enhances readability and reduces eye strain.  
  - Text: Light-colored text (#f5f6f7) ensures contrast and clarity.  

- **Typography:**  
  - Font: Uses **Tahoma** for readability and consistency.  
  - Font Size: A base size of **16px** for accessibility.  

- **Fieldsets and Inputs:**

  - Inputs: Styled with a dark background (#0a0a23), light text, and ample spacing for comfortable interaction.  

- **Responsive Layout:**  
  - The form adjusts to various screen sizes with a flexible width (60vw) and constraints (min-width: 300px; max-width: 500px).  
  - Inputs and the submit button scale dynamically to ensure usability across devices.

### **Accessibility Features**

- **Label Associations:**  
  All input elements are linked to their respective labels using the `for` attribute for screen reader compatibility.  

- **Required Attributes:**  
  Key fields (e.g., first name, email, password, terms) are marked as required, guiding user input effectively.  

- **Error Prevention:**  
  The password field uses a pattern for validation (`[a-z0-5]{8,}`), ensuring security standards.
